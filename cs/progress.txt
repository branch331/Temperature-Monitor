8/10/18:

-Started w/ cal audit example; stripped down code so now it only shows temp
-need to figure out how to loop this
-how to display graph?

8/13/18:

-added stop button as skeleton; no functionality yet

8/14/18:

-While loop to query all hardware resources for temperature
-added stop button callback: will set StopMonitor flag to True

Next Steps:
-databind to graph; right now it's databinded to the location on the table (needs testing w/ real HW)
	-Convert data back to doubles
-auto-create legends
-UI changes (decsription/instructions, button layout)
