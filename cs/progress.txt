updating Hardwareviewmodel; changed from hardwareresrouce => productresource
UI can't fit all headers well, not sure how much to change it

Next Steps:
*Looking for temperature reading property... escalate
need to implement filter/logic for internal/ext cal data to be shown
edit worker.cs

8/9/18:
working on Filter in worker.cs
issue is that FindHardware returns hardwareresourcebase but in hardwareviewmodel we have productresource class

Looks like product resource inherits from hardwareresourcebase >> hardwareresource >> productresourcebase >> productresource

Tried casting (Line 14 of HardwareViewModel: ProductResource productResource = resource as ProductResource;) maybe? no errors

simulated device needed for testing. program runs fine but nothing to test with

added internal/external support if statements (HardwareViewModel line 22, 28)

in hardwareviewmodel, if the prop doesnt exist or whatever it won't display anything on table
	maybe this is only for simulated devices...?

Next Steps:
-Confirm if temperature property exists or not
-make field red if calibration date is overdue
-test w/ hardware (simulated or not). Change back 'IsSimulated' property to False for filter
-fix hardwareviewmodel (test w/ real HW first)

8/10/18:
-Works w/ NI 9221, 9263 in cDAQ-9178
-Works w/ 8135 chassis and 6368 card
Seems to be working w/ real hardware

-Edited UI to enable text wrapping in header; changed title of UI

-Trying to implement temperature readings (good)

-Trying to make field red if cal date is overdue. I think it works!

-Error code ignores "does not support int cal" error; displays on UI if error does occur

-Change recommended last cal dates, and rec next cal dates to ignore hour/min value to shorten space on UI

Next Steps:
-test w/ test plan
-remove comments/debugging parts of code
