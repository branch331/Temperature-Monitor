8/10/18:

-Started w/ cal audit example; stripped down code so now it only shows temp
-need to figure out how to loop this
-how to display graph?

8/13/18:

-added stop button as skeleton; no functionality yet

8/14/18:

-While loop to query all hardware resources for temperature
-added stop button callback: will set StopMonitor flag to True

Next Steps:
-databind to graph; right now it's databinded to the location on the table (needs testing w/ real HW)
	-Convert data back to doubles
-auto-create legends
-UI changes (decsription/instructions, button layout)
-add temperature limit (C); stop program if above limit

8/16/18:
-Added Temperature Limit textbox control to UI
-Updated UI to have temperature board monitor instructions/description
-Inefficient method of checking temperature limits (every single time we query temps, loop thru each resource and check if temp_limit prop of HardwareViewModel class is reached)

Next Steps:
-databind to graph; right now it's databinded to the location on the table (needs testing w/ real HW)
	-Convert data back to doubles
-auto-create legends
-UI button layout

8/20/18:
-red border on textbox for temperature limit, seems to be validationerror but i cant get rid of it
-got rid of red border by setting default text value from code behind
-removed comments; finished up UI

Next Steps:
-test plan
